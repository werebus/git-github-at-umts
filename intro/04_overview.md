~~~SECTION:notes~~~
Is this presentation going to be a bit fan-boy-ish? Probably. I *really*
like git and I hope you will too, but ultimately what's important is
that you're doing *something* to track your source code.

I want to cover enough of Git that we can all know what I'm talking
about, but a slideshow isn't the best way to learn this stuff.  I'll
have some resources at the end.
